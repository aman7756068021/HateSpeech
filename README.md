# HateSpeech Detection system

-- Developed a sophisticated model to detect hate speech using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), enhancing the accuracy of text classification.

-- Defined "Hate Speech" as offensive discourse targeting a group or individual based on inherent characteristics, such as race, gender, or religion, to ensure a clear scope for the model.

-- Collected and pre-processed a diverse dataset containing various examples of hate speech and non-hate speech to train the RNN effectively.

-- Implemented text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words to improve the model's performance.

-- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving a high level of accuracy in identifying hate speech.

-- Collaborated with a team to fine-tune the model's parameters and integrate it into a larger system for monitoring social media platforms.
